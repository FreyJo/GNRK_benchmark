This repository contains the code to reproduce the benchmark results presented in the paper:

"Gauss-Newton Runge-Kutta Integration for Efficient Discretization of Optimal Control Problems with Long Horizons and Least-Squares Costs"
by Jonathan Frey, Katrin Baumg√§rtner and Moritz Diehl

It was tested with acados v0.2.5
